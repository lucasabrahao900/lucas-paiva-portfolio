# Portfolio - Lucas Paiva

Hello! 

Here, I'll showcase some projects I've worked on during my personal 'free' time. These projects not only demonstrate my skills to the general public but also aim to share ideas and thoughts about exciting projects. My hope is that they'll someday inspire someone with knowledge.

## Projects

### MLB Shiny App 

This project was developed using the R language with the Shiny Framework to present statistics from Major League Baseball (MLB) teams. I implemented a data scraping mechanism from an MLB reference statistics page and leveraged Shiny to create an application featuring dynamic visualizations for team comparison. Shiny was chosen due to its excellent capabilities for dynamic coding and its user-friendly interface, making it easy to build a web application even without prior knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript.
